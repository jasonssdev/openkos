# Delta for Reindex Command

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Prune Removed Documents

The orchestrator MUST prune from `vectors` and `vector_meta` any
`concept_id` present in `vector_meta` whose source `.md` file no longer
exists on disk. WHEN `okf._walk_errors(bundle_dir)` reports one or more
directory-scan errors for this run, the orchestrator MUST skip the entire
prune pass for that run — no `concept_id` is removed — because an
unreadable subtree can make a still-existing document look absent from the
walk, and treating that absence as deletion would silently destroy a valid
vector. The embed and cache-hit passes MUST still run normally regardless
of walk errors.
(Previously: any `concept_id` absent from the current walk was pruned
unconditionally, with no distinction between "genuinely deleted" and "walk
could not reach it".)

#### Scenario: Deleted doc is pruned from the store

- GIVEN a `vector_meta` row for a concept whose file was deleted from the
  bundle, and the walk reports no directory-scan errors
- WHEN `reindex` runs
- THEN that concept's rows are removed from both `vectors` and
  `vector_meta`

#### Scenario: Walk error suppresses pruning for the whole run

- GIVEN a bundle subdirectory that raises a scandir `OSError` during the
  walk (e.g. permission denied), and that subdirectory holds a document
  whose `concept_id` already has a `vector_meta` row
- WHEN `reindex` runs
- THEN that `concept_id`'s row is NOT pruned from `vectors` or
  `vector_meta`, even though the walk did not see it this run
- AND the embed and cache-hit passes still complete normally for every
  document the walk did reach

#### Scenario: No walk errors preserves normal pruning behavior

- GIVEN a bundle whose walk completes with zero directory-scan errors
- WHEN `reindex` runs
- THEN pruning proceeds exactly as before this change, removing only
  `concept_id`s genuinely absent from the walk
