# Delta for Ingestion

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Ingest Raw Copy and Source Concept Generation

`openkos ingest <path>` MUST copy the raw source into the bundle's raw
storage as an exclusive (create-only) binary write and generate exactly one
OKF Source concept with frontmatter `type`, `title`, `description`,
`resource`, `tags`, `timestamp`, plus OpenKOS-layer `status`, `version`,
`freshness`, `sensitivity`, and `provenance`. In addition, `ingest` MUST
attempt LLM-driven extraction of a **bounded list** of derived objects —
zero up to a hard cap of 5 — each of a type in the 9-type classifiable
vocabulary (`{Concept, Entity, Place, Event, Procedure, Decision, Project,
Person, Organization}`) from the source. WHEN extraction succeeds, for EACH
derived object that passes per-item validation and survives staging, `ingest`
MUST write that derived object IN ADDITION to the Source concept, with
`provenance` pointing to the Source and `sensitivity` inherited from the
Source. WHEN extraction fails, is unavailable, times out, errors, or leaves
no valid surviving object, `ingest` MUST degrade to Source-only behavior —
write only the Source concept, emit an explanatory note to stderr, and exit 0
(no crash). Extraction always runs regardless of `--auto`; `--auto` only
skips the confirmation prompt. WHEN the source decodes as UTF-8 text, the
Source concept's BODY MUST embed that text verbatim under a labeled section,
followed by `# Citations`. WHEN the source is not valid UTF-8 text, the body
MUST instead contain a short, honest note that the content could not be
embedded as text (no crash), followed by `# Citations`. An empty source MUST
render a body distinct from both the verbatim and undecodable cases. The
generated Source concept MUST pass `check_conformance`. The `description`
MUST remain a single line (no newlines) and MUST state that the raw source's
content was embedded verbatim, and MUST NOT claim extraction or splitting
into derived concepts.

`ingest` MUST derive `title` from the decoded raw content, in this
precedence, and MUST use the same derived value for the frontmatter `title`,
the Source document's own `# ` heading line, the `index.md` bullet label,
and the `log.md` entry label:

1. The first ATX H1 (`# ` line) that is not inside a fenced code block.
2. Otherwise, only the first non-blank body line is considered, and only
   when it is **title-plausible**; derivation does NOT scan further lines
   looking for one that qualifies.
3. Otherwise, `_titleize(src.stem)` (today's behavior), unchanged.

A candidate from (1) or (2) MUST be normalized — strip surrounding
whitespace, collapse internal whitespace runs to one space, strip a trailing
ATX closing `#` sequence — then validated; any validation failure falls back
to (3).

A line is **title-plausible** only when ALL hold: non-empty after strip;
followed by a blank line or end-of-file; at most 120 characters; does not
end in `.`, `,`, `;`, or `:`; does not begin with markdown block syntax
(`-`, `*`, `>`, `#`, a table pipe, or a code fence).

A normalized candidate MUST be rejected (falling back to (3)) when it
contains any ASCII control character, `\n`, `\r`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, a
backtick, `*`, `_`, `<`, `>`, `|`, or exceeds 120 characters.

It MUST also be rejected when it contains a Unicode invisible or
direction-altering character: the zero-width and directional marks
`U+200B`-`U+200F`, the bidirectional embedding and override controls
`U+202A`-`U+202E`, the bidirectional isolates `U+2066`-`U+2069`, the line
and paragraph separators `U+2028`-`U+2029`, or the byte-order mark
`U+FEFF`. These reach the terminal and markdown link labels unescaped, and
`U+202E` in particular can visually reorder the text that follows it.

Ordinary non-ASCII text MUST NOT be rejected. Accented letters, CJK
characters, emoji and typographic dashes are all valid title content.

A leading `---` line MUST be skipped as frontmatter only when a closing
`---` line exists later in the file; otherwise it is ordinary content.
WHEN `raw_content` could not be decoded as UTF-8, or is blank or
whitespace-only, title derivation MUST NOT run and `title` MUST be (3).

`slug` remains derived from the filename only and is unaffected by this
requirement; the Source document's filename and concept id do not change.
This requirement does NOT read a source's own YAML `title:` field, does NOT
recognize setext headings, and does NOT backfill already-ingested Sources.

(Previously: `title` was always `_titleize(src.stem)`, with no content-derived
candidate or fallback chain.)

#### Scenario: Successful ingest embeds verbatim text

- GIVEN an initialized workspace and a readable UTF-8 text source at
  `<path>`
- WHEN `openkos ingest <path>` completes (confirmed or `--auto`)
- THEN the raw source is copied, one Source concept exists whose body
  contains that source's text verbatim under a labeled section followed by
  `# Citations`, `check_conformance` reports no violations, and
  `index.md`/`log.md` reflect the new entry

#### Scenario: Path does not exist

- GIVEN `<path>` does not exist or is not readable
- WHEN `openkos ingest <path>` runs
- THEN it exits non-zero, writes a clear error to stderr, and no file is
  created or modified

#### Scenario: Already-ingested source is refused, not overwritten

- GIVEN `raw/<name>` or `bundle/sources/<slug>.md` already exists for this
  source
- WHEN `openkos ingest <path>` runs
- THEN it refuses in Phase A, exits non-zero with a clear error, and
  writes nothing

#### Scenario: Successful extraction yields a Concept

- GIVEN a source whose content clearly describes an idea, topic, or
  framework, and a fake LLM backend returning a well-formed structured
  reply of `type: Concept`
- WHEN `openkos ingest <path>` completes
- THEN both the Source concept AND a Concept document are written, the
  Concept's `provenance` references the Source, and `check_conformance`
  reports no violations for either document

#### Scenario: Successful extraction yields an Entity

- GIVEN a source whose content clearly describes a concrete tool, product,
  or artifact that is not a person or organization, and a fake LLM backend
  returning a well-formed structured reply of `type: Entity`
- WHEN `openkos ingest <path>` completes
- THEN both the Source concept AND an Entity document are written, and the
  Entity's `provenance` references the Source

#### Scenario: Multiple distinct objects are all written

- GIVEN a source genuinely about several distinct objects, and a fake LLM
  backend returning a well-formed array of multiple validly-typed objects
  (at or under the cap)
- WHEN `openkos ingest <path>` completes
- THEN the Source concept AND one derived document per surviving object are
  written, each with `provenance` referencing the Source, and
  `check_conformance` reports no violations for any document

#### Scenario: Undecodable source falls back without crashing

- GIVEN a source at `<path>` that is not valid UTF-8 text (e.g. binary)
- WHEN `openkos ingest <path>` completes
- THEN `ingest` does not crash, the raw copy is still made byte-identical,
  and the Source concept's body honestly states the content could not be
  embedded as text, with no false claim of embedded content

#### Scenario: Empty source renders a distinct body

- GIVEN a source at `<path>` that is zero-length
- WHEN `openkos ingest <path>` completes
- THEN the Source concept's body distinctly indicates the source was
  empty, distinguishable from both the verbatim-embed and
  undecodable-fallback cases

#### Scenario: First ATX H1 becomes the title

- GIVEN a source whose first non-fenced `# ` line reads `# Introduction to
  Stoicism`
- WHEN `openkos ingest <path>` completes
- THEN the Source's frontmatter `title`, its own `# ` heading line, its
  `index.md` bullet, and its `log.md` entry all read `Introduction to
  Stoicism`

#### Scenario: An H1 inside a fenced code block is ignored

- GIVEN a source whose first `# ` line appears inside a fenced code block,
  followed later by a real `# Chapter One` heading outside any fence
- WHEN `openkos ingest <path>` completes
- THEN the title is `Chapter One`, not the fenced line's text

#### Scenario: No H1, a title-plausible first line is used

- GIVEN a source with no `# ` heading anywhere, whose first line is `Call
  with Maria Salazar — 2026-07-14` followed by a blank line
- WHEN `openkos ingest <path>` completes
- THEN the title is `Call with Maria Salazar — 2026-07-14`

#### Scenario: Wrapped prose first line is not title-plausible

- GIVEN a source with no `# ` heading, whose first line is the start of a
  wrapped prose paragraph with no blank line immediately after it
- WHEN `openkos ingest <path>` completes
- THEN the title falls back to `_titleize(src.stem)`

#### Scenario: A candidate carrying a forbidden character falls back

- GIVEN a candidate title (from an H1 or a title-plausible line) that,
  after normalization, contains `[`, `]`, a backtick, or another forbidden
  character
- WHEN `openkos ingest <path>` completes
- THEN the title falls back to `_titleize(src.stem)`

#### Scenario: A candidate over 120 characters falls back

- GIVEN a candidate title that, after normalization, exceeds 120 characters
- WHEN `openkos ingest <path>` completes
- THEN the title falls back to `_titleize(src.stem)`, with no truncation

#### Scenario: A well-formed leading frontmatter block is skipped

- GIVEN a source starting with `---`, a YAML block, and a closing `---`
  line, followed by a real `# Chapter One` heading
- WHEN `openkos ingest <path>` completes
- THEN the title is `Chapter One`; the frontmatter's own `title:` key, if
  present, is not read

#### Scenario: An unclosed leading `---` is treated as content

- GIVEN a source starting with a `---` line with no later closing `---`
  anywhere in the file
- WHEN `openkos ingest <path>` completes
- THEN the `---` line is evaluated as an ordinary candidate line, fails the
  title-plausible predicate (begins with markdown block syntax), and the
  title falls back to `_titleize(src.stem)`

#### Scenario: A binary source uses the slug title

- GIVEN a source whose bytes do not decode as UTF-8
- WHEN `openkos ingest <path>` completes
- THEN title derivation does not run and the title is
  `_titleize(src.stem)`

#### Scenario: An empty source uses the slug title

- GIVEN a source at `<path>` that is zero-length or whitespace-only
- WHEN `openkos ingest <path>` completes
- THEN title derivation does not run and the title is
  `_titleize(src.stem)`

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Idempotent Title Derivation

Title derivation MUST be a pure function of the raw bytes: re-ingesting a
byte-identical raw file MUST produce a byte-identical Source document,
including its derived `title`.

#### Scenario: Byte-identical re-ingest yields a byte-identical Source

- GIVEN a source previously ingested, whose raw bytes are unchanged
- WHEN that same source is ingested again (e.g. after a revert and re-run)
- THEN the resulting Source document, including its derived `title`, is
  byte-identical to the one produced by the original ingest
