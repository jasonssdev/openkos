    This function IS Phase A in full: every check below runs strictly
    BEFORE any write, and the returned list is the COMPLETE, already-deduped
    write set -- Phase B (in `ingest`) does nothing but `mkdir` +
    `write_exclusive` per plan, with no existence check, slug work, or
    dedup left there (design D5 pinned ordering), so a failure partway
    through Phase B never leaves a partially-reconciled state.

    Returns `[]` -- always a Source-only degrade for this batch, never a
    raised error -- when: `raw_content` is `None` or blank (a
    binary/undecodable or empty source has no text to extract from, so the
    LLM is never called); `llm.chat` raises any `OllamaError`-family
    exception (caught HERE, per design's "Degrade seam" --
    `extraction/concept.py` lets it propagate unswallowed); or

    `extract_concept`'s contract -- design D4 -- meaning either nothing was
    worth extracting, or every candidate failed ITS OWN fail-closed
    validation; this layer does not distinguish the two).

    Each item in a non-empty `extract_concept` result is then staged
    independently, in reply order, per design's pinned Phase A sequence:
    (1) derive a slug from the title -- an empty slug (a title made only of
    characters `_slugify` strips) skips just that candidate; (2) an
    in-batch collision guard -- a slug already claimed by an EARLIER
    candidate in this SAME reply keeps the first and drops the later one
    (spec: In-Batch Slug-Collision Guard); (3) `derived_path.exists()` -- a
    slug already on disk for ANY source (this source's own prior
    extraction, a hand-authored file, or a genuine cross-source slug
    collision) skips this candidate, leaving the existing file untouched.
    This REPLACES the old provenance-keyed `_source_has_derived_object`
    all-or-nothing gate with PER-SLUG reconciliation (design D5): a
    re-ingest now calls the LLM again and can insert a genuinely NEW object
    even when an older one for the same source already exists, at the
    accepted cost that a nondeterministic LLM title can slugify differently
    across re-ingests and produce a duplicate object. (4) `okf.build_concept`
    -- untrusted LLM fields that slipped past `extract_concept`'s own
    validation (e.g. an embedded newline) can still fail `build_concept`'s
    stricter single-line gate (`ValueError`), which skips just that
    candidate.

    Every one of these four main.py-visible drops (empty slug, collision,
    exists, build failure) is reported to stderr, per candidate (design D4
    drop transparency); a candidate dropped inside `extract_concept`'s own
    validation stays silent there, unchanged from today.

    LLM extraction of zero or more distinct derived objects, up to
    `extraction.concept._MAX_OBJECTS_PER_SOURCE` (multi-object-extraction,
    PR 2; D5).

    Beyond the MVP-1 "null compiler" (exactly one `Source` concept per
    invocation, with an honest description stating the source was imported),
    this now also attempts ONE LLM-driven extraction step -- one call to
    `extract_concept` per ingest, which itself returns a bounded LIST: an
    injected `OllamaClient` classifies the source's decoded text against the
    full classifiable vocabulary (`openkos.model.types.CLASSIFIABLE_TYPES`)
    and proposes zero, one, or several distinct objects. Any candidate that
    fails validation, collides with an earlier candidate's slug in the same
    batch, or already exists on disk is dropped individually, never the
    whole batch; if the LLM call itself fails or nothing survives at all,
    this degrades to the exact same Source-only result MVP-1 always
    produced, with a short note on stderr and exit 0. A successful
    extraction ADDS zero or more additional, create-only derived documents
    -- one file per validated, staged candidate, under `bundle/concepts/`,
    `bundle/entities/`, `bundle/people/`, `bundle/organizations/`,
    `bundle/places/`, `bundle/events/`, `bundle/procedures/`,
    `bundle/decisions/`, or `bundle/projects/` -- alongside the Source,
    never replacing it. See `_stage_derived_objects` for the full staging,
    degrade, and reconciliation matrix.

    Phase A (pure, no writes) validates and builds the entire result in
    memory, in order: `src` must be an existing, readable file, or this
    refuses; the current directory must already be a workspace (both
    `bundle/index.md` and `bundle/log.md` present), or this refuses; the
    destination name and concept slug are derived ONLY from `src`'s
    basename (`Path(src).name`/`.stem` -- directory components, including
    traversal segments like `../../evil.txt`, are always stripped, so the
    raw copy and concept document can never land outside `raw/` or
    `bundle/sources/`). When `raw/<name>` already exists, `src`'s bytes are
    compared against it (full-byte, before any write): identical bytes make
    this an idempotent re-ingest -- `raw/<name>` is reused untouched and only
    the Source concept plus `index.md`/`log.md` are regenerated, regardless
    of whether the concept already exists (closes the `forget`-then-`ingest`
    trap) -- while differing bytes refuse (raw sources are immutable). When
    `raw/<name>` is absent but `bundle/sources/<slug>.md` exists, this
    refuses as an inconsistent workspace (no raw bytes to compare against).
    Otherwise `read_config` resolves `default_sensitivity`, the Source
    concept is computed in memory, extraction is attempted (always, even
    under `--auto` -- only the confirmation PROMPT is skipped), the derived
    objects (zero or more -- `_stage_derived_objects`' already-reconciled,
    deduped result) are staged, the new `index.md`/`log.md` bytes are
    computed to cover the Source and every staged derived object, and a
    preview of the proposed changes -- listing the Source and every staged
    derived object -- is printed.

    Confirm gate, checked in order: `--auto` skips the prompt outright;
    otherwise config `review: false` skips the prompt the same way;
    otherwise, if stdin is a TTY, `typer.confirm` asks and aborts (exit 1)
    on decline; otherwise (non-TTY, `review: true`, no `--auto`) this
    refuses to write (exit 1) rather than defaulting silently, telling the
    user to re-run with `--auto` -- this intentionally diverges from
    `init`'s silent-on-non-TTY behavior, because `ingest` honors "review
    before save".

    Phase B (after confirm) writes, in order: `bundle/sources/` (created if
    absent), the raw copy (`copy_exclusive`, create-only) and the concept
    document (`write_exclusive`, create-only) on a fresh ingest -- or, on a
    byte-identical re-ingest (D2), the raw copy step is SKIPPED entirely and
    the concept is written via non-exclusive `write_atomic` instead, since it
    may already exist -- then, for EACH staged derived object in staging
    order (zero or more; `_stage_derived_objects` already computed and
    deduped the full write set in Phase A, so this loop does nothing but
    `mkdir` + `write_exclusive`, with no existence check or dedup left
    here, design D5), its own directory (`bundle/concepts/`,
    `bundle/entities/`, `bundle/people/`, `bundle/organizations/`,
    `bundle/places/`, `bundle/events/`, `bundle/procedures/`,
    `bundle/decisions/`, or `bundle/projects/`, created if absent) and its
    document (`write_exclusive`, create-only -- always, regardless of
    whether the Source itself was fresh or regenerated) -- then `index.md`
    and `log.md` (`write_atomic`, catalog LAST -- so the catalog never
    points at a file that does not yet exist, mirroring `init`'s
    marker-last ordering, D3), extended to cover each staged derived
    object's own bullet/log entry, in staging order. Every one of these
    writes is itself create-only or atomic, so none is ever left
    half-written -- but Phase B as a whole is NOT transactional:
    there is no rollback across the sequence (`init`'s D3 "no cleanup
    path" position, retreated to here after an attempt at real rollback
    proved it could not be made truly atomic across independent filesystem
    writes). A failure partway through leaves whatever already landed in
    place -- e.g. a raw copy or concept document written but not yet
    reflected in `index.md`/`log.md` -- a detectable, recoverable partial
    result, never silent corruption (content is always written before the
    catalog, so the catalog never references a file that does not exist).
    Because the OKF bundle is version-controlled, recovery is `git status`
    to see the partial result and `git checkout`/`git clean` to restore --
    not a manual unlink. Any failure -- Phase A or Phase B -- is caught and
    reported on stderr (exit 1), not a raw traceback; `except (OSError,
    ValueError)`, matching `init`'s convention.

    Phase A (pure, no writes) validates and builds the entire result in
    memory, in order: the current directory must already be a workspace
    (the same `config.require_workspace` gate `ingest`/`status`/`lint`
    share), or this refuses; `concept_id` is resolved via
    `_resolve_concept_path`, which rejects an absolute id, any `..`
    segment, a reserved basename (`index`/`log`), or a nonexistent concept
    file -- all as `ValueError`, all refusing before any write. `index.md`
    is then searched, via `bundle_index.remove_index_entry`, for a bullet
    in ANY section (Sources, Concepts, People, Decisions) whose first
    markdown link resolves to `concept_id` -- matching is generic across
    sections, never Sources-only (#922). A `log.md` entry is built in
    memory via `bundle_log.insert_log_entry` (a plain `**Forget**` line,
    never a tombstone marker). A preview of the proposed changes is then
    printed: `~ index.md (remove entry)` only appears when at least one
    bullet matched (zero matches is drift, not an error -- the deletion
    still proceeds); `~ log.md (new dated entry)` and `- bundle/<concept_id>.md`
    always appear.

    Confirm gate, identical precedence and mechanism to `ingest`: `--auto`
    skips the prompt outright; otherwise config `review: false` skips it
    the same way; otherwise, on a TTY, `typer.confirm` asks and aborts
    (exit 1) on decline; otherwise (non-TTY, no `--auto`) this refuses to
    write (exit 1), telling the user to re-run with `--auto`.

    Phase B (after confirm) writes `index.md` then `log.md`
    (`write_atomic`, catalog FIRST) and deletes the concept file
    (`fsio.remove_file`) LAST -- the inverse of `ingest`'s content-then-
    catalog ordering, preserving the same invariant either way: `index.md`
    never references a file that does not exist. This is NOT transactional
    as a whole: a failure partway through (e.g. the unlink itself) leaves a
    benign, git-recoverable partial result -- the catalog already updated,
    the concept file possibly still present as an orphan -- never silent
    corruption. Any failure, Phase A or Phase B, is caught and reported on
    stderr (exit 1), not a raw traceback; `except (OSError, ValueError)`,
    matching `ingest`'s convention.

    Known limitation (deferred to MVP-2, per the proposal's non-goals):
    other concepts that still link to the forgotten one are left with a
    dangling inbound reference -- this is neither detected nor rewritten
    here.
