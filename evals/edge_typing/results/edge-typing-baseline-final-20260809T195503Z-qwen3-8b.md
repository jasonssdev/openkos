# `suggest_edge_types` eval — arm `baseline-final` (#508)

_Generated: 20260809T195503Z_ · model `qwen3:8b` · **5 runs** over 15 labelled edges.

Labels are CONSTRUCTED, not adjudicated — see `fixtures.py`. Read accuracy as rubric-consistency, and trust **stability** when a label is arguable: it needs no labels at all.

| metric | value |
| --- | --- |
| type accuracy vs label | 0.33 |
| mean stability (modal share) | 1.00 |
| degraded replies | 0 of 75 |
| mean run latency | 19.6s |
| mean stated confidence, CORRECT answers | 0.00 |
| mean stated confidence, WRONG answers | 0.00 |

A threshold policy is only meaningful if the second number is clearly below the first. Equal values mean stated confidence carries no signal about correctness, and gating on it would automate the errors instead of catching them.
